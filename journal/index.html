                This image was one of the first images that I had captured for
                DES 113. It was my first day wandering the neighborhoods around
                campus, and I had noticed a cat sitting not the wall, staring at
                me. Instantly, I rushed to take a photo with it and it struck a
                pose with its tongue sticking out. This photo remains as one of
                my most favorite shots from the course, and although I had not
                familiarized myself with camera settings yet, the aperture was
                exactly how I wanted it to turn out. The cat in focus, while the
                surrounding foliage blurred in the background.
              </p>
              <p>
                This image relates to my collection of cats I have encountered
                around Davis. Some of them are reoccurring characters, and I
                always see them around the same spots. Some of them I know their
                names, and others are characters that have passed away since
                meeting them.
              </p>
              <p>
                This collection is a tale of time describing my experiences
                walking around and getting to know Davis neighborhoods. From
                these sightings, one can infer the locations that I have
                frequented often over the past four years I have spent at Davis.

                To figurines sitting on public transportation seats, where one
                is reading a newspaper and the other is asleep. The image looks
                like it takes place in a public setting, like at a mall.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most interesting aspects of the image are the figurines
                because their colors stand out and they are clearly performing
                some sort of action, whether it be reading or sleeping. The
                background also draws interest as well and provides visual clues
                that the figurines are actually quite small and are placed on a
                table or surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most obvious aspect of this image is that the figurines are
                small and placed on a surface. The most mysterious aspect of
                this image is where the image takes place. You can tell that it
                is in a public setting, but it is unclear why the figurines are
                there and how they got there. The person in the background also
                adds mystery to the image—who is the person and are they related
                to the figurines/story behind the photo in any way? The
                figurines itself also tell a mysterious story. Do the two
                characters know each other? What are their names, if any?

              The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and
              Visual Thinking Skills” discusses methods to encourage deeper
              visual thinking through images. The most striking images are ones
              that foster communication and collaboration with others, and
              ultimately the sharing of new ideas, questions, and knowledge. In
              this article, I noticed that many of the photos that it featured
              were particularly striking because they had some sort of story
              behind them. The photos all had a living creature or human in
              them, or were intriguing because they were taken in a foreign
              place. The photos that featured some sort of movement were
              especially interesting as well.

              One website that uses both images and interaction that I found was
              <a href="https://cosmos.so" target="_blank">cosmos.so.</a> This
              website is a web application that is similar to Pinterest and
              allows users to gather and collect images that they find across
              the web. By using scrolling effects, parallax, animations, and
              simply creating collages of images on their website, the user is
              visually intrigued all while learning more about what cosmos has
              to offer. My main takeaway from observing this website is that
              images and interactions are crucial to keeping a user engaged when
              you are trying to tell a visual story.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The article “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing
              Lightboxes” discusses the mass popularity of overlays among
              designers, and the situations in which overlays should and should
              not be used. Overlays should be used in moderation, and are
              intended for users to view content, complete a form, or make a
              decision. If the purpose is to view content, the content should be
              brief as well. Overlays should not be lengthy to the point where
              the user must scroll and use multiple navigation mechanisms within
              it. When completing a form or making a decision, the actions, as
              well as the cancel button should be clearly visible and explicit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overlays often pose an obstacle to users as they interrupt the
              user from their current action. To avoid this sense of
              interruption, overlays should be used in the beginning of the user
              flow. An alternative is to make the overlay open by the user’s own
              action, such as clicking on a button to open the overlay.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main takeaway from this article, however, is that overlays
              should only be used if there is a compelling case for why the
              overlay content should not be presented on the original page.
              These cases include actions with serious consequences, required
              information before proceeding to the next step, or content that is
              urgent.

            <p>
              The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari
              discusses the various ways a designer can improve the user
              experience of forms. Many of the methods to improve form UX
              follows the simple guideline of “less is more”. This principle
              ultimately minimizes the user’s “cognitive load and visual noise,”
              preventing the user from being overwhelmed by too many steps or
              information. Another guideline is to make things as clear and
              labelled as possible at all times. This prevents any confusion on
              the user’s side, and assists them in completing the form faster
              with more clarity. From colors to placement of text to the
              phrasing of instructions and feedback, even the simplistic of
              design choices are crucial to crafting an easy experience for form
              users.
            </p>

            <p>
              An example of a website form with excellent UX is Airtable.
              Airtable offers a feature where users can create their own
              customized forms with default designs that follow simple, but
              elegant form design practices, such as “less is more” and
              prioritizing clarity with labels, colors, and etc. Here is an
