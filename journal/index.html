            <p>The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills” discusses methods to encourage deeper visual thinking through images. The most striking images are ones that foster communication and collaboration with others, and ultimately the sharing of new ideas, questions, and knowledge. In this article, I noticed that many of the photos that it featured were particularly striking because they had some sort of story behind them. The photos all had a living creature or human in them, or were intriguing because they were taken in a foreign place. The photos that featured some sort of movement were especially interesting as well. </p>
            <p>One website that uses both images and interaction that I found was <a
              href="https://cosmos.so"
              target="_blank"
              >cosmos.so.</a> This website is a web application that is similar to Pinterest and allows users to gather and collect images that they find across the web. By using scrolling effects, parallax, animations, and simply creating collages of images on their website, the user is visually intrigued all while learning more about what cosmos has to offer. My main takeaway from observing this website is that images and interactions are crucial to keeping a user engaged when you are trying to tell a visual story. </p>

            <p>
              The article “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing
              Lightboxes” discusses the mass popularity of overlays among
              designers, and the situations in which overlays should and should
              not be used. Overlays should be used in moderation, and are
              intended for users to view content, complete a form, or make a
              decision. If the purpose is to view content, the content should be
              brief as well. Overlays should not be lengthy to the point where
              the user must scroll and use multiple navigation mechanisms within
              it. When completing a form or making a decision, the actions, as
              well as the cancel button should be clearly visible and explicit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overlays often pose an obstacle to users as they interrupt the
              user from their current action. To avoid this sense of
              interruption, overlays should be used in the beginning of the user
              flow. An alternative is to make the overlay open by the user’s own
              action, such as clicking on a button to open the overlay.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main takeaway from this article, however, is that overlays
              should only be used if there is a compelling case for why the
              overlay content should not be presented on the original page.
              These cases include actions with serious consequences, required
              information before proceeding to the next step, or content that is
              urgent.

              The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari
              discusses the various ways a designer can improve the user
              experience of forms. Many of the methods to improve form UX
              follows the simple guideline of “less is more”. This principle
              ultimately minimizes the user’s “cognitive load and visual noise,”
              preventing the user from being overwhelmed by too many steps or
              information. Another guideline is to make things as clear and
              labelled as possible at all times. This prevents any confusion on
              the user’s side, and assists them in completing the form faster
              with more clarity. From colors to placement of text to the
              phrasing of instructions and feedback, even the simplistic of
              design choices are crucial to crafting an easy experience for form
              users.
            </p>

            <p>
              An example of a website form with excellent UX is Airtable.
              Airtable offers a feature where users can create their own
              customized forms with default designs that follow simple, but
              elegant form design practices, such as “less is more” and
              prioritizing clarity with labels, colors, and etc. Here is an
              example of an
              <a
