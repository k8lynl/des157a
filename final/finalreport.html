            <h3>
              Who reviewed your code and what qualifications do they possess
              that makes their opinions on design valid?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I had my friend review my codeâ€”he is a software engineer at
              Amazon. Not only does he have an undergraduate and Masters
              education in Computer Science, he is also currently doing frontend
              work in his team.

            <h3>What was discussed?</h3>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/error1.png"
                alt="id"
                style="width: 950px; height: 325px"
              />
              <figcaption>Id instead of class</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              One of the things he caught within my code was using an id versus
              a class for one of my buttons. Because the button would only be
              used once and only has a unique, single purpose, he told me that
              it would be better if it had a id instead.
            </p>

        <div class="column">
          <article>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/error2.png"
                alt="navigation"
                style="width: 950px; height: 325px"
              />
              <figcaption>Page Navigation</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Another piece of advice he gave me was using a simpler way to
              navigate through the pages of the content. Originally, I had a
              function that would hide all the pages and show the current one,
              but he told me that I could just hide the current page and show
              the next one, as opposed to hiding all of the pages.

              <img
                src="../images/error3.png"
                alt="function"
                style="width: 950px; height: 250px"
              />
              <figcaption>Unnecessary function call</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Lastly, he caught a mistake where I was unnecessarily calling a
              function twice, when it only needed to be called once at the very
              end.

            <article>
              <p>
                In regards to adding a randomize button, I was struggling to get the code to work when I added my word lists to a separate js file. After many attempts to troubleshoot under limited time, he suggested that I just shorten my word lists and include them locally in the script.js. This way, the script.js. file would not be too long while keeping the code functional and working.
